# Object_Finder

This project contributes to object detection applications. When performing object detection, the parameters in the HSV(Hue Saturation Value) color space are used as the threshold value.


## Usage

```python
python object_detection.py 
python object_detection_trackbar.py
```


## Optimizations

To make maximum use of the code, run the python code-named trackbar on the image where you will detect the object. In this section, the trackbar will appear on the screen and you can constantly change the limit values ​​and make object detection actions more consistent.


## Screenshots
For a successful object detection application, you must set the threshold values ​​correctly. You may encounter false positives when the threshold values ​​are not set correctly.
